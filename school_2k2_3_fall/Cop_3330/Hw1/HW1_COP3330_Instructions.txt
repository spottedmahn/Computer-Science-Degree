This project requires you to do some simple io operations and math computations.

First there may or may not be any command line parameters.  If there is a command line parameter it 
will be a number, N, greater than 1 and less than 100.  Your job will be to read from standard input
N lines.  On each line will be a positive number, A.  You should compute A factorial, A!, and output
one result per line.   If there are no command line parameters, or once you have read in the N 
numbers you should do the 2nd part of the project.  This part will require that you again read in
lines one at a time from standard input.  Your program should stop once the string "quit" is 
entered on a line by itself.   If the line is anything other than "quit" you should output "valid
word" if the word is valid.  For our purposes a word is valid if the sum of the ASCII values of
its characters is divisible by 3 or 5 or 7 or 11 or 13.  If the word is not valid then print out the string
"not valid"   In either case read the next input line from the standard input stream and
continue processing until the quit command has been reached.
