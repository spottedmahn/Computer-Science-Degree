Not on your life big fella, this assignment is mighty tough.  
Having worked now worked for days without much rest or anything, I am pretty miffed at Jim.
 If I get a hold of his lecture files, I will delete them in a jiffy and hope he can't restore them.
 I am now pretty tired of typing this so istop here.
