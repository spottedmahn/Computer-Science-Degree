<P>Opening commentary for your C program:</P>
</B></FONT><P>As discussed in class, we are expecting a block of comments at the beginning of your program. In addition to being a useful habit to form, this will be helpful to the graders if there are problems in connecting files received by email with their authors.</P>
<P>The first few lines of your program should resemble the sample program: <A HREF="http://www.cs.ucf.edu/courses/cop3223-1-spr02/CommentedHello.htm">http://www.cs.ucf.edu/courses/cop3223-1-spr02/CommentedHello.htm</A></P>
<P>Now you are ready to email a copy of the program to the grader.</P>

<P>1. Type the program using any text editor. </P>
<P>2. Save the program (with name such as: filename.c) <BR>
To make it easy for the grader, name the file with your full account number followed by an underscore '_' and the assignment number.&nbsp; (Example: ama55555_1.c) </P>
<P>3. Compile the program (with command such as: gcc filename.c) </P>
<P>4. Fix errors (using a text editor) and save changes, then compile again. <BR>
(Repeat this step as many times as needed) </P>
<P>5. Run the program by typing the execution file name (typically a.out) </P>
<P>6. If the output is incorrect, repeat Steps 4 and 5 as many times as needed. <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5><P>To rename a C program:</P>
</B></FONT><P>If you have your program created under a name other than the filename suggested above, you will want to rename it before submission. For example, let's suppose you have a file in your directory called hw1.c and you want to submit it. If your id is joe01225, you will want to call the new file joe01225_1.c</P>
<P>To rename the file to joe01225_1.c from hw1.c. At the command prompt, type: <BR>
mv joe01225_1.c hw1.c</P>
<P>Now you are ready to email a copy of the program to the grader.</P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5><P>To make a printable copy of output:</B></FONT> </P>
<P>1. At the command prompt, type: <BR>
script output.txt </P>
<P>2. Run the program (typically using a.out) </P>
<P>3. At the command prompt, type: exit </P>
<P>4. This creates a file called output.txt. (You can use another name). <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5><P>To print a file</B></FONT> called filename.ext: <BR>
At the command prompt, type: <BR>
lpr -Pprinter1 filename.ext <BR>
&nbsp; </P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5><P>To Email a copy of the program to the grader:</B></FONT> </P>
<P>1. At the command prompt, type: pine <BR>
(This will start the Pine Email application) </P>
<P>2. Press the key 'c' to compose a message. </P>
<P>3. Where it says "<B>TO:</B>" type: cop32231 </P>
<P>4. Using arrow keys, move down to the field "<B>Attachmnt:</B>" </P>
<P>5. Press Ctrl-t </P>
<P>6. Use arrow keys to highlight the file you are sending. </P>
<P>7. Press enter. </P>
<P>8. Using arrow keys, move down to the body of the message. </P>
<P>9. Type your full name and assignment number. </P>
<P>10. Press Ctrl-x </P>
<P>11. Press 'y' </P>
<P>12. To quit, press 'q' <BR>
