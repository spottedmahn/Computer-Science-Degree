I debugged my program using various inserts and deletes.

some of my test cases:
1)
insert 10, 25, 15, 20
delete 15

2)
insert 88, 45, 33
delete 88, 33

3)
insert 55, 66, 77, 88, 44, 33
delete 33, 77, 

I used my result to determine that my program was running properly.  I don't know how else to
discuss how I used my  testing results to help me debug.
