notes:

Instructor also needs quiz field.
The first field of student and instructor is agentid, not name.
when reading in student instance, score is not read in.
Instructor needs a constructor similar to student:  Instructor(ifstream fin)
Fix Capital letter difference in sample input and in get methods
Add field currConcept to Agent class (not instructor class)
0 < Understanding < 1 - fact not understood
