There have been a number of small changes you should note.

(1)  Method IOMgr::pushToMargin(ofstream& fout, int delta) throw(IOError);
     In the Lab1 specification document, the description of this method was
     incorrect - this has been fixed.  This method is supposed to combine
     the functions of pushMargin() and deltaMargin().

(2a)  Method IOMgr::deltaMargin(ofstream& fout, int delta) throw(IOError);
     The "throw( IOError )" was missing from its declaration in the header
     file.  Fix that, or download the updated header file.

(2b)  Method IOMgr::deltaMargin(ifstream& fout, int delta) throw(IOError);
      This is a new method - its specification has been added to the Lab1
      specification document.  Basically it does for input streams what
      its overloaded copy does for output streams.  However, the semantics
      are somewhat different.  The primary purpose of this method is to
      provide a pushback or putback capability for parsing input streams.
      This method is necessary to handle pushback if a Tokenizer or
      StringTokenizer is not used to parse an input stream. 

(3)  Methods NextChar() and IsDelim() were defined in class Tokenizer as
     private methods and were also included in the class declaration for 
     StringTokenizer.  However, there was no specification for these 
     methods in the Lab1 spec. document.  You may or may not need them in
     StringTokenizer.  If you decide they would be helpful in the implementation
     of StringTokenizer, then go ahead and use them, but they may need to be
     modified.  

(4)  Method StringTokenizer::Catbuff(string astr); was omitted from the header
     file - this has been fixed.  Make the change in your header file or download
     a new one.

(5)  Classes Agent, Instructor, and Student class interface specs have been changed.
     (a)  Extract, Insert must be public virtual methods in all three classes.
     (b)  Get and Put must be protected virtual methods in all three classes.
     (c)  operator<< and operator>> should be declared only in class Agent.
